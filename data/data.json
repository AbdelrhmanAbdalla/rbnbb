You can use the bike map to decide if this is a good option for you based on your itinerary and how much you like biking. We think that one of the best ways to enjoy Austin is by bicycle, and most people who have stayed with us have loved the freedom of being able to bike around the city. • Buses - There's a bus stop down the street from our house and Capital Metro's Trip Planner is pretty great for learning how to get from place to place. Buses generally arrive about every 20 minutes, but the buses aren't always on time and they don't run very late. You can also put bikes on the bus, but there is only space for two",

I'm the one who manages our Airbnb listing, but I live with my partner, Miguel, and Catbus, an orange cat who adopted us a few years ago. Miguel works at a Mediterranean cafe, and also does screen printing, carpentry, and landscaping work. We both love meeting new people and opening up our home to fun folks who need a short-term place to stay in Austin.
